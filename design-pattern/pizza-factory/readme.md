# The problem
- We are building a pizza shop website
- There could be many pizza shop in the country, each shop has a different way to make pizza
- The web "doesn't care" how the pizza is create, it just need a pizza so it can adding topping on it and sale, so, by delegate creating pizza for the factory, we can be more flexible how the pizza is create => if we want another kind of pizze, we just inject new factory, no need to change the code of the website
